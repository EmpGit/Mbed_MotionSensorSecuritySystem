# Mbed_MotionSensorSecuritySystem
This code is used for the Mbed circuit group project. The motion sensor for the Mbed circuit acts as a security system. When the motion sensor detects some motion, the 7 segment display will countdown from 9-0. Within this time, the security system has to be deactivated. Once the countdown reaches to zero, the passive buzzer will activate.
